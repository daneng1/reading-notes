# Design with CSS

---

CSS adds style to HTML elements to make the page look pretty. It does this with properites applied to elements.

CSS treats HTML elemnts as if they are inside their own box, using rules to indicate how the element should appear.

**Rules** are selectors and declarations, which specift the element to apply the rule to and what they should look like.

**Declatations** are made up of two parts: the properties you want to change and the value of those properties.

CSS rules appear in a different document from the HTML file.

## Using Color
* Colors can be identified by using **RGB values, HSL, HEX codes and simple names.**
* Foreground color or text color is selected using `color` in CSS.
* Background color is the color you select for anything behind the text and can be selected using `backgound-color` in CSS.
* Contrast - when picking foreground and background colors it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between them so the text can be easily read.
* Opacity is defined as the `A` value in `RGBA` and controls the transparency of the color.
* HSL is anouther way to select a color using Hue, Saturation, Lightness and also Opacity "A".
