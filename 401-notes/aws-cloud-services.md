## Questions

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle - WRRC is the process where a client(ie a browser window) makes a request to a server, via the internet. The server takes in the request, does something like look up a page or grab some data from a database and then sends a response back to the client. The client (web browser) takes in the response and usually does something with it, like display a webpage or some data that was returned in the response.
1. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC - a server is the piece of hardware and software that the client sends a request to. It typically lives in a data center where it can access many other servers via the local network. Once the server processes the request, it sends back a response to the client.
1. What does it mean to “deploy” an application? - when you deploy an appication it means that you have made the application available on a server. That could be on your loacl machine or in the cloud but either way, it means the application can now be accessed through a WRRC.
