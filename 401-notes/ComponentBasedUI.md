# Component Based UI

## Questions

- Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React).
  -JQuery, Lodash, D3, Glimmer, Angular
- What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
  - Generally, a JS library is a reusable piece of code that oftentimes has one primary use case. A library can consist of several functions/objects/methods, depending on the language. Your application can “link” to a library to allow you access to that functionality.
  - On the other hand, a JS framework has more control of your app. It helps direct you on the architecture and the project that follows. Frameworks consist of multiple libraries and they provide you with hooks and callbacks, so you can continue to build upon them.

## Vocabulary

- *Rendering* - this is what gets displayed in the browser window and when you refreah the page, all the content is rendered. In React, it only re-renders what has been changed and that is way more efficient than rendering the whole page when maybe only one single element was updated.
- *Templates* - these are re-usable pieces of code that provide a starting place for further development.
- *State* - state is the current condition of of an element.
