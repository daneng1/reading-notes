- Don't start trying to solve code immediately.
- Make sure you undestand the problem before trying to solve it.


## Steps to Solve Programming Problem

1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

- Up to 70% of time should be spent on steps 1-3.
- Read the problem atleast twice, maybe 3-4 times if needed.
