# Ethics In Tech

> Tech has long dubbed itself as an agent for making the world a better place, and yeah, there are many examples of how tech has improved the lives of millions or even billions of people. But there are also some very concerning side effects that have come from the massive proliferation of tech in our daily lives.

## $$Data

- Data has become one of the biggest and most valuable commodities in the world. It impacts people and events in ways that no one could have imagined a few years ago.

### Privacy and Data Ownership

- Every day when we get on social media, use a smart speaker to search the web or download a podcast, we are giving away our data to corporations that could be using it in ways that we may not approve of or selling it to companies that we don't support.
- All that data that is being constantly collected and shared or sold can have massive impacts on our lives from only seeing news stories that fit within our personal beliefs or even being denied for a credit card or loan.
- We are unwittingly and involuntarily giving away our data and we need to find a way to take back the ownership and value of our data.

### Impacts of Data

- In 2016, we saw a massive political shift towards a radicalized right-wing perspective all across the world. 
  - In the UK, data was used to influence votes and ultimately led to Brexit despite the overwhelming facts that teh UK would be far better off if it stayed in the EU.
  - In the US, politicians used data and social media to spread lies and hatred across our nation, resulting in a demagog being elected as our president.
  - Both of these events were the result of very specific data mining and targeting. When companies or political groups use personalization, aka discrimination, to target specific messages to specific people, alternate versions are created and sometimes for the purpose of creating instability.

### What Can We Do?

- First thing is to turn off any data gathering that we can in all the apps and websites we use. 
- Second is to call and write Congress to ask for updated legislation to protect the data of individuals and put the ownership of data back in the hands of then individual
- Lastly, minimize data sharing by not logging into any website using your Google or Facebook account. These are some of the biggest data collection points and give those companies access to a trove of data they wouldn't normally receive.
