# Lessons in Problem Solving

> Programming is essentially about finding a more efficient way to solve a problem.

## Problem Solving is the meta-skill

- Common problem solving process:
  1. Try a solution.
  1. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
  1. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
- A better way involves having a framework and practicing it.

### Framework

1. Understand

- Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

- How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

2. Plan

- Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

- Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

3. Divide

- Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.

- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

- Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

4. Stuck?

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).


### Practice

- Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”
- Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….

- In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.
