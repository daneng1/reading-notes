# AWS S3 and Lambda

## What are they?

> S3 stands for Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

> AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

### Questions

1. Describe “The Cloud” - the cloud is simply clusters of servers that you can access from anywhere in the world through the interenet. These servers are not your own and you don't have to manage them.
1. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)? - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
1. What is auto-scaling? - Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that enables organizations to scale cloud services such as server capacities or virtual machines up or down automatically, based on defined situations such as traffic ir utilization levels.
1. What is bandwidth? - bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.
1. How do cloud providers compute service costs? - In AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute your functions use, plus any network traffic generated. For workloads that scale significantly according to time of day, this type of billing is generally more cost-effective.

### Vocab

- *Server Instances* - When you launch a Server, an Instance will be launched in the specified cloud infrastructure. You cannot launch a Server without subsequently launching an Instance. 
- *Containers* - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
- *Cloud Services* - The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.
- *Cloud Architecture* - Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. 
- *AWS* - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.
- *EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku* - they are bascially the same and provide a way to run our code in production. Heroku has a much high cost for basic features but is easier to configure.
