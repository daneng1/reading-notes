# Value Your Time

> Pretend your time is worth $100/hour and you will become more productive.

- Busyness isn't a badge of honor, its a sign of weakness.
- Focus on tangible action towards what truely matters.
- Busyness and stress are the enemy!
- As you think, so you are.
  - If you let people know that your time is free or low-valued, people will treat you as such.
  - Probably need to say no more often.

> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” Steve Jobs
