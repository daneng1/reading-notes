# Data Modeling

### Questions

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development?

- Better program design and higher code quality.
- Detailed project documentation.
- TDD reduces the time required for project development.
- Code flexibility and easier maintenance.
- With TDD you will get a reliable solution.
- Save project costs in the long run.

1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- When you want to create data to test before each test and then delete the data after each test. You would use `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` when you want to run the same code block for all tests.

1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?

- Writing tests before writing code means that we need to know the requirements of the software and the specification of the code before starting to code the solution.

1. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

- A class can have many Constructors but must not have the same parameters. A class can have many methods but must not have the same parameters. A Constructor cannot be inherited by subclasses. A Method can be inherited by subclasses.

1. Why REST?

- One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.

### Definitions

- **functional programming** - Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”.
- **object-oriented programming (OOP)** - Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.
- **class** - Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.F
- **super** - The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
- **this** - The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. ... In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined . In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)** - Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- **Jest** - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** -  is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.
- **REST** - REST or RESTful API design (Representational State Transfer) is designed to take advantage of existing protocols. 
- **Data Model** - A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
