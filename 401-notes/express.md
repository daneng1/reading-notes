### What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

> The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.

### SOAP vs REST

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) was originally created by Microsoft, and it’s been around a lot longer than REST. This gives it the advantage of being an established, legacy protocol. SOAP performs operations through a more standardized set of messaging patterns.

- REST (Representational State Transfer) operates through a solitary, consistent interface to access named resources. It’s most commonly used when you’re exposing a public API over the Internet.
