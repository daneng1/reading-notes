**A computer is a machine that does thinking tasks by taking inout, storing information, processing the info and then outputting something.**

All info in a computer is stored in 1's and 0's, called Binary Number System. Everything can be represented by 1/0 on/off true/false.

Wires and circuits in the computer store the data and electrical signals tell the computer if the data is a 1 or a 0.

8 wires can store up to 255 numbers while 32 wires can store 4 billion numbers.

Everything you see on a computer is reprented by Binary.
