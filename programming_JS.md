# Programming with JS

---

## So how do we use JS to add functionality to our website?

JS allows us to access and modify content, apply program rules and react to events. As we learened, these actions are all created using detailed instructions called scripts. **You need to map out all the steps necessary for the script to work properly.**

1. Define the goal
1. Design the script
1. Code each step

## Expressions

An expression evaluates iput into a single value. They come in two types, one just assigns a value `val color = 'beige';` and the other uses two or more values to return a single value like `var area = 3 * 2;`

### Expressions rely on operators to form a value.
* Assignment is just putting a value to a variable.
* Arithmetic will perform math.
* String will combine two strings.

## Functions

Functions let you group together a series of statements to perform a specific task. 

> `function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello!');`
}

This function will write "Hello!" in the browser.

Declaring functions that need information or input require parameters. So measuring area of a wall would require height and width values. 

>`function getArea(width, height) {
    return width * height:
}`

Now you need an arguement to complete the function.

>`wallWidth = 3:
wallHeight = 5:
getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);`
