# Team Dynamics


* Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — recently became focused on building the perfect team. 
* In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.
* Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. 
* After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.
* Researchers noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared.
    * On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking".
    * The good teams all had high "average social sensitivity" — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
* There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. 
* data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
* In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
