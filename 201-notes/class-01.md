## HTML 

All web pages utilize HTML markup to create the structure of the page. HTML is a language that uses tags and elements to tell the browswr how to display the content of the page.

Every page uses the same three elements:
1. Head
1. Title
1. Body

Beyond that there are several element tags that can be used to designate content to a specific part of the page. Block level elements like `<header>` ,`<p>` and `<section>` are used to take up as much space they need on the page. Inline elements like `<strong>`, `<span>` and `<a>` take up just the space they need.

## Extra Markup

HTML allows for extra markup that doesn't get seen by the viewer of the site, like comments and some info that tells the browser to do something but not display any info.

## HTML Layout

The best place to start when building a new website is to understand your viewer. **Who are they, why are the visiting the page and what info do they need** are all good questions to answer before beginning.

The next step is to wireframe the page which is just a fancy way to say sketch it out using boxes that represent key parts of the page. 

After that, build a sitmap which will tell you how the various pages will link together and where key information will be kept.

**What is a script?**

Scripts are instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal. The instructions must be very detailed in order for the computer to follow them correctly. When writing a script, it is best to start with a flow chart that maps all the steps needed to complete the task, then you can start coding those tasks.
