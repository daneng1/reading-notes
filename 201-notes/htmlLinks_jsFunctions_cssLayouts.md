# Functions

* Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task.
* Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code.
* Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. The information passed to a function are known as ***parameters***.
* If you write a function that should give you a response, the response is known as a ***return value***.
* To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements neede to achive its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function ***declaration***.
* Once you declare the function, you can then execute all of the statements bewteen its curly braces with just one line of code. This is ***calling*** the function.
