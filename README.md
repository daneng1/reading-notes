### Growth Mindset
Here's how to stay in a growth mindset

This Thought                          | Replace with This
|--------------------                 | :------------------------------|
| I'm not good at this                | No one is good at the beginning! |
| I give up                           | Trying a new strategy will give you a way forward! |
| This is too hard                    | It's meant to be hard! We grow by challenging ourselves! |
| I made a mistake                    | That proves you put in effort! |
| I'll never be that Smart            | Being smart is somethging you learn. You aren't done getting smarted! |
| My classmates can do it but I can't | There was a time they couldn't either. |
| I don't know                        | YET! |


> A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
