This is a collection of my reading notes for CodeFellows.

## About Me

I'm an avid trail runner, snowboarder and backpacker. I also enjoy chilling outside, sitting around a campfire with my wife and daughter, enjoying smores and good company with friends!

--

I've worked in the commercial photography world for the last 20ish years and during that time I have worked as a photo assistant, photographer, retoucher, editor and team manager. Most recently I worked at REI for 8 years. In April I was laid off along with a few hundred of my colleagues. Since then, I've spent the summer hanging with my daugher and doing some home reno projects while finding my next career path.

I came to Code Fellows as a result of some soul searching about what I want from a career and job. I've explored a few options from woodworking to project management and after chatting with a friend about coding, I discovered we had a mutual friend who is a teacher at Code Fellows. I talked with her about the program and felt like coding was within my reach. Then I discoved that a former colleague who was also laid off in April had just graduated from the dev ops program. She loved the program and spoke highly of the teachers and TA's. After that, it was just a matter of signing up for the first available class!
