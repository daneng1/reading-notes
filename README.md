### Growth Mindset

Defined as...
> **"A growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities."** Carol Dweck


### How to Get Into a Growth Mindset

|               This Thought          |       Replace with This |
|------------------------------------ | ------------------------------|
| I'm not good at this                | No one is good at the beginning! |
| I give up                           | Trying a new strategy will give you a way forward! |
| This is too hard                    | It's meant to be hard! We grow by challenging ourselves! |
| I made a mistake                    | That proves you put in effort! |
| I'll never be that Smart            | Being smart is somethging you learn. You aren't done getting smarted! |
| My classmates can do it but I can't | There was a time they couldn't either. |
| I don't know                        | YET! |

### Ways I can Embrace a Growth Mindset

* Be sure to not compare my work to others too critically, rather try to learn from them
* When I get stuck, look for another way or ask for help
* Recognize that this is a journey and the more I embrace it the more I will gain
