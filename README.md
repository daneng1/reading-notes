### About Me

I'm an avid trail runner, snowboarder and backpacker. I also enjoy chilling outside, sitting around a campfire with my wife and daughter, enjoying smores and good company with friends!

I've worked in the commercial photgraphy world for the last 20ish years and during that time I have worked as a photo assistant, photographer, retoucher, editor and team manager. Most recently I worked at REI for 8 years. In April I was laid off along with a few hundred of my collegues. Since then, I've spent the summer hanging with my daugher and doing some home reno projects.

I came to Code Fellows as a result of some soul searching about what I want from a career and job. I've explored a few options from woodworking to project management and after chatting with a freind about coding, I discovered a common friend is a teacher at Code Fellows. I chatted with her about the program and felt like it was more in my reach. Then I also discoved that a former collegue who was also laid off in April just graduated from the dev ops program. She loved the program and spoke highly of the teachers and TA's. After that, it was just a matter of signing up for the first available class!
