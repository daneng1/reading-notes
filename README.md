### Growth Mindset
Here's how to stay in a growth mindset

This Thought | Replace with This
|-------------------- | :------------------------------|
| I'm not good at this | No one is good at the beginning |
| I give up | Trying a new strategy will give you a way forward |
| This is too hard | It's meant to be hard! We grow by challenging ourselves |


A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
