## TEXT EDITORS
### What is a text editor?
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.


### Basic Text Editors vs Coding Specific Editors
* basic text editors that come on your computer have no special bells or whistles
* there is no syntax highlighting, no themes and no extensions
* basic text editors may have unnecessary options for making text bold, underlined, or italic. Stick to plain text.


### Most important features of a text editor are: 
1. code completion
1. syntax highlighting
1. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
1. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
1. emmet shorthand language

### Tips
It's a good idea to try various text editors to find the one you like the best. Some coders even switch editors periodically when new updates are released.

## COMMAND LINE and TERMINAL

### What is a command line?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.


### How do command lines work?
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

Start with the command, add an arguement and then a location to create a more complex task. 
**Here is an example: ls -l Documents**, "ls" is the list command "-l" indicates a long list and "Documents" is the directory we are targeting with this task.

### Paths
A path is just a location of a directory. Paths come in two flavors, relative and absolute. Absolute is always relative to your root drectory and begin with /. Relative paths specify a location based on where you are currently in the directory. They will begin with a character and not a /.


### Some Basic Commands
* **pwd** = print working directory which will show you the current folder you are in 
* **ls** = list files in the current directory
  * **ls -l** = list file in list order and adds more info
* **ls -a** = list all files in a directory including hidden files
* **~** = shortcut for home directory
* **..** = reference to parent directory
* **cd** = change directory and is usually followed by a path you want to target 
  * **cd -** = change back to previous directory
  * **cd ..** = to go up one folder
* **file** = shows the file type and data associated with the file specified
* **cp** = copy file (requires file name and location)
* **rm** = remove file or folder (rm Documents/test.jpg)
* **mv** = move and/or rename file or folder
* **tab** = auto complete after entering first character
* **touch** = create new file
* **mkdir** = create a folder
