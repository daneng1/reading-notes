**Directories**, or folders should be used for larger sites to organize your pages.

**RealtiveURL's** can be used when linking between differnt pages on your site and they are formatted like `reviews.html`.

**Email Links** will oown up an email and send it to a pre-determined email.

**Opening Links in New Windows** can be done using the target value inside the `<a>` tag.

# CSS Layout

***`<div>`*** elements are often used to contain elements and group sections of the page.

Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute or fixed positioning.

***Float*** property moves content to the left or the right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts.

Pages can be fixed width or stretchy layouts.

Its a good idea to keep page width to 960-1000 pixels and indicate what the site is about at the top 600 pixels of the page.

Grids help create professional looking layouts and flexible designs

CSS Framewors provide rules for common tasks, making the process easier.

# Functions

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters or information required to do their job and return a value.

* Functions are also not necessarily executed when the page loads and can be stored until an action triggers them.
