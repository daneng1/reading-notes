- In VS Code I added a new file called growth_mindset.md and moved all the related content from my README.md file to the new file.Â 
- Next I updated the README.md file because I removed a bunch of content and added it to the growth_mindset.md file.
- Then I added my growth_mindset.md file to GitHub. This is brand new and didn't exist there so it needed to be added for proper syncing.
